If You institute patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
                     <p>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</p>
                     <p>(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this License; and</p>
                     <p>(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed the files; and</p>

                     <p>(d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as modifying the License.</p>
                     <p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License.</p>
                     <p>5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\ by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
                     <p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
                     <p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.</p>
                     <p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
                     <p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.</p>
                     <p>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</p>

                work of authorship. For the purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not
                include works that remain separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the

                     <p>"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
                version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative
                Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work
                by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on

                managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and
                improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or

                     <p>2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
                this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
                non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce,
                prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and
                distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.</p>
                     
                     <p>3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
                License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
                non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
                section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
                otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those patent claims
                licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
                Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the Work to
                which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against
                any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the
                Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or
                contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this
                License for that Work shall terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.</p>
                     
                     <p>4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
                Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source
                or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:</p>
                     
                     <p>You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy
                of this License; and You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                stating that You changed the files; and You must retain, in the Source form of any
                Derivative Works that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                attribution notices from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that
                do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and If the Work includes a
                "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution, then any Derivative Works that You
                distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained within
                such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the
                Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
                distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display
                generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
                appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and do
                not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution notices within Derivative
                Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the
                Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
                modifying the License. </p>
                     
                     <p>You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
                provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
                or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole,
                provided Your use, reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies
                with the conditions stated in this License. 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless
                You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally submitted for
                inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions
                of this License, without any additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the
                above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license
                agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.</p>
                     
                     <p>6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
                names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
                required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and
                reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.</p>
                     
                     <p>7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to
                in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
                Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
                either express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or
                conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
                PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or
                redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of
                permissions under this License.</p>
                     
                     <p>8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
                whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
                applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in
                writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,
                indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as
                a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work (including
                but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
                malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
                Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>
                     
                     <p>9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the
                Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
                acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or
                rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may
                act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any
                other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
                Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
                Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional
                liability.</p>

                Licensable by such Contributor to use, reproduce, make available, modify, display,

                     <p>b. under Patent Claims of such Contributor to make, use, sell, offer for
                sale, have made, import, and otherwise transfer either its Contributions or its
                Contributor Version.</p>

                     <p>The licenses granted in Section 2.1 with respect to any Contribution

                     <p>2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope</p>
                     
                     <p>The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
                this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the distribution
                or licensing of Covered Software under this License. Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b)
                above, no patent license is granted by a Contributor:</p>
                     
                     <p>a. for any code that a Contributor has removed from Covered Software;
                or</p>
                     
                     <p>b. for infringements caused by: (i) Your and any other third party’s
                modifications of Covered Software, or (ii) the combination of its Contributions with
                other software (except as part of its Contributor Version); or</p>
                     
                     <p>c. under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of
                its Contributions.</p>
                     
                     <p>This License does not grant any rights in the trademarks, service marks,
                or logos of any Contributor (except as may be necessary to comply with the notice
                requirements in Section 3.4).</p>
                     
                     <p>2.4. Subsequent Licenses</p>
                     
                     <p>No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
                distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this License (see
                Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if permitted under the
                terms of Section 3.3).</p>
                     
                     <p>2.5. Representation</p>
                     
                     <p>Each Contributor represents that the Contributor believes its
                Contributions are its original creation(s) or it has sufficient rights to grant the
                rights to its Contributions conveyed by this License.</p>
                     
                     <p>2.6. Fair Use</p>
                     
                     <p>This License is not intended to limit any rights You have under
                applicable copyright doctrines of fair use, fair dealing, or other equivalents.</p>
                     
                     <p>2.7. Conditions</p>
                     
                     <p>Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted in
                Section 2.1.</p>
                     
                     <p> 3. Responsibilities</p>
                     
                     <p> 3.1. Distribution of Source Form</p>
                     
                     <p>All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
                Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under the terms of
                this License. You must inform recipients that the Source Code Form of the Covered
                Software is governed by the terms of this License, and how they can obtain a copy of
                this License. You may not attempt to alter or restrict the recipients’ rights in the
                Source Code Form.</p>
                     
                     <p> 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form</p>
                     
                     <p>If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:</p>
                     
                     <p>a. such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code Form,
                as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of the Executable Form
                how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code Form by reasonable means in a timely
                manner, at a charge no more than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and</p>
                     
                     <p>b. You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
                License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the license for the
                Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter the recipients’ rights in the
                Source Code Form under this License.</p>
                     
                     <p>3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work</p>
                     
                     <p>You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
                provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for the Covered
                Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered Software with a work
                governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the Covered Software is not
                Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this License permits You to additionally
                distribute such Covered Software under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so
                that the recipient of the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the
                Covered Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
                License(s).</p>
                     
                     <p>3.4. Notices</p>
                     
                     <p>You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
                (including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty, or
                limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of the Covered
                Software, except that You may alter any license notices to the extent required to
                remedy known factual inaccuracies.</p>
                     
                     <p>3.5. Application of Additional Terms</p>
                     
                     <p>You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
                indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered Software.
                However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on behalf of any
                Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
                indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree to
                indemnify every Contributor for any liability incurred by such Contributor as a
                result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include
                additional disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
                jurisdiction.</p>
                     
                     <p>4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation</p>
                     
                     <p>If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
                License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to statute, judicial
                order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with the terms of this License to the
                maximum extent possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the code they affect.
                Such description must be placed in a text file included with all distributions of
                the Covered Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
                or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a recipient of
                ordinary skill to be able to understand it.</p>
                     
                     <p>5. Termination</p>
                     
                     <p>5.1. The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
                if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become compliant, then
                the rights granted under this License from a particular Contributor are reinstated
                (a) provisionally, unless and until such Contributor explicitly and finally
                terminates Your grants, and (b) on an ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to
                notify You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You
                have come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular Contributor
                are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor notifies You of the
                non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the first time You have received
                notice of non-compliance with this License from such Contributor, and You become
                compliant prior to 30 days after Your receipt of the notice.</p>
                     
                     <p>5.2. If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
                infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions, counter-claims, and
                cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes
                any patent, then the rights granted to You by any and all Contributors for the
                Covered Software under Section 2.1 of this License shall terminate.</p>
                     
                     <p>5.3. In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all end
                user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which have been
                validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License prior to termination
                shall survive termination.</p>
                     
                     <p>6. Disclaimer of Warranty</p>
                     
                     <p>Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is” basis,
                without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including,
                without limitation, warranties that the Covered Software is free of defects,
                merchantable, fit for a particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to
                the quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You. Should any Covered
                Software prove defective in any respect, You (not any Contributor) assume the cost
                of any necessary servicing, repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty
                constitutes an essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is
                authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.</p>
                     
                     <p>7. Limitation of Liability</p>
                     
                     <p>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort (including
                negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor, or anyone who
                distributes Covered Software as permitted above, be liable to You for any direct,
                indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character including,
                without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
                computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses,
                even if such party shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This
                limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or personal injury
                resulting from such party’s negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such
                limitation. Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
                incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply
                to You.</p>
                     
                     <p>8. Litigation</p>
                     
                     <p>Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the courts
                of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal place of business and
                such litigation shall be governed by laws of that jurisdiction, without reference to
                its conflict-of-law provisions. Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party’s
                ability to bring cross-claims or counter-claims.</p>
                     
                     <p>9. Miscellaneous</p>
                     
                     <p>This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
                matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such
                provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. Any
                law or regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be construed
                against the drafter shall not be used to construe this License against a
                Contributor.</p>
                     
                     <p>10. Versions of the License</p>
                     
                     <p>10.1. New Versions</p>
                     
                     <p>Mozilla Foundation is the license steward. Except as provided in Section
                10.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to modify or publish new
                versions of this License. Each version will be given a distinguishing version
                number.</p>
                     
                     <p> 10.2. Effect of New Versions</p>
                     
                     <p>You may distribute the Covered Software under the terms of the version of
                the License under which You originally received the Covered Software, or under the
                terms of any subsequent version published by the license steward.</p>
                     
                     <p> 10.3. Modified Versions</p>
                     
                     <p>If you create software not governed by this License, and you want to
                create a new license for such software, you may create and use a modified version of
                this License if you rename the license and remove any references to the name of the
                license steward (except to note that such modified license differs from this
                License).</p>
                     
                     <p>10.4. Distributing Source Code Form that is Incompatible With Secondary
                Licenses If You choose to distribute Source Code Form that is Incompatible With
                Secondary Licenses under the terms of this version of the License, the notice
                described in Exhibit B of this License must be attached.</p>

                relevant directory) where a recipient would be likely to look for such a notice.</p>
                     
                     <p>You may add additional accurate notices of copyright ownership.</p>
